**Mobile Recommendation System**

This project implements a recommendation system for mobile phones using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system extracts relevant features like RAM, storage, battery capacity, and camera specifications from unstructured text data and provides personalized recommendations based on user preferences. It includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and a user interface built with Streamlit. The goal is to help users find the most suitable mobile phone according to their needs efficiently.
